This is a multithreaded 2-D game implemented in the Java programming language. It is about the player 
who had robbed a place and is trying to reach his/her safehouse without getting caught by zombies, police,
or bandits. The player clicks on nodes for his/her character to move to that node. This is implemented with
the dijkstra's algorithm. There are also specials that the player can use to help him/herself get through
to the safehouse.
